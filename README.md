A hodgepodge of my creation

This site was created, at first, as my own shot at world anvil - and it's what you're gonna see when running it for first time.
There are some funny quirks on main site, like right panel opening only when search bar is focused, whereas left bar is for header navigation on site.
Also, try playing with keys HOME, END, INSERT and DELETE. If you already have some keybinds on them, welp. 

Overall, now it's just...
## A dump of ideas
Yeah, seems right. Add /Misc after adress to see all small projects I do. List below.

- Kreator Postaci / Character Creator - A simple idea for quick and dirty game/novel character display. Needs ID to be entered in the input at the bottom to show anythig, currently there are only 3 id's - 0,1 and 2
- ChillApp - So I had that funny moment in my life when anxiety was striking me hard, and I mean hard. My shrink shown me app that displayed a flat, filled in circle growing and shrinking to dictate breathing speed. It was surprisingly good, but there pretty much weren't any for desktops, so I made my own. Well, set to make, didn't finish.
- Zabawa z suwakami / Fun with sliders - Talking with friend about worldbuilding and looking at <progress>, decided to play around to better understand it. Site is as impressing as in grass in the middle of field.
- Migacz / Blinker - Wanted to try and in some capacity simulate old CRT screen blinking. I mean...this works I guess? Satisfied with outcome, anyway.
- Blask / Shine - Tried to understand how do you achieve that backlight effect, you know, like with neons. While I am not happy with the outcome, I did learn something, so yeah.
- Animacja z lat 80' / 80's Animation - The Grid. Oh how I love that style, it's simple yet captivating, rough yet dynamic. Yeah, I dunno what I am talking about. Nonetheless, I like it so I tried to made it - mostly as an excuse for working with JS and HTML's SVG. Learned quite a lot...like for example to rely more on CSS for animations. Hah.
- Aplikacja do tworzenia mini historii / Mini stories creation app - Unfinished project that I am still working on, trying to make it as close to RESTful API as I am able to. Generally CRUD application for simply dynamic story creation and storage, based on template of title - banner/image - story. Still need to add a lot to it, like proper editing, headers, bolder text etc.
